# Weather App 🌤️
A simple website build using an API with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JSON to fetch real-time weather data from an external Weather API. This project demonstrates my ability to work with APIs and create interactive web applications.

# 🚀 Features
* Displays current weather conditions for a user-specified location.
* Fetches data in real-time using a Weather API.
* Shows:
  * Temperature (Celsius/Fahrenheit)
  * Weather description (e.g., Sunny, Cloudy, Rainy)
  * Humidity, wind speed, and more!
* Responsive design, usable on both desktop and mobile devices.

# 🛠️ Technologies Used
* HTML: For structuring the webpage.
* CSS: For styling the app (optional: add details if styled).
* JavaScript: For fetching data and updating the UI dynamically.
* JSON: For parsing API responses.
* Weather API: [7Timer](https://www.7timer.info/doc.php?lang=en#civil)
